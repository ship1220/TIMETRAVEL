# 🕰️ TimeLens VR

**TimeLens** is a VR experience that lets users travel through time — exploring the **Jurassic Age**, the **Present**, and a speculative **Future Age**. Built in Unity using XR technology, the project combines immersive environments, interactive elements, and educational storytelling to create a journey where players solve puzzles, uncover clues, and navigate across eras to return to the present.
